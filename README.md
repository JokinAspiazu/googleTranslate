# googleTranslate, This is me goofing around with Google Translate API

# Code is based on this tutorial about how to run Google Translate using API
# https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-translation-python3#0
# I picked this tutorial since the setup process was really straightforward.


# All you need to do is run the tutorial setup before running this script with Google Cloud Shell.

# The test stript is a very happy path test asking a few translations of the "Hello World" phrase.
